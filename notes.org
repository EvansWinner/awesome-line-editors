8-Bit Home Computer Era

Apple Program Line Editor (Apple II series, 1982)
A dedicated line-numbered editor from A.P.P.L.E. (Apple PugetSound Program Library Exchange) for tweaking BASIC/assembly code. Command-driven like ed, with insert/delete by line range. Comes on disk images for emulators.
Archive: https://www.ebay.com/itm/226149589254 (or search Call-A.P.P.L.E. archives)
TRS-80 Editor/Assembler Series I (TRS-80 Model I/III, 1981)
Tandy's official line-oriented editor bundled with their assembler package. Handles line addressing, printing, and substitutions via commands like L (list lines) or D (delete range). Feels very ed-like for batch editing. Manuals and disk images are floating around retro sites.
Manual: https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/system-80/software-manuals/manuals-Editor-Assembler-Tandy.pdf
Commodore BASIC Line Editor (PET/C64/VIC-20, 1977–1982)
Not a standalone tool, but the built-in BASIC interpreter acts as a de facto line editor—enter lines by number, edit with LIST, EDIT n, or RENUM. Obscure in hindsight as a "whole-system editor," but it powered most early C64 coding. (If you want something more distinct, check emulated "Simon Ed" variants, though they're borderline screen-based.)

Pre-8-Bit Curios (Mainframes/Minicomputers)
These predate home computers but set the stage for ed-style tools. Perfect for a "Historical Precursors" sub-appendix.

Colossal Typewriter (PDP-1, ~1961)
One of the earliest interactive line editors, basically a teletype-based text manipulator for debugging punch-card code. Commands for line insert/delete/print; it's more proof-of-concept than usable today, but emulatable.
Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors#Line_editors
EXP (CTSS, ~1965)
A pioneering line editor from MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System, influencing QED/ed. Line-range ops like substitute/print; historical only, but source/docs in retro computing archives.
Info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_editor
EW (Multics, ~1972)
Multics' line editor, with advanced pattern matching and macros. Feels like a beefed-up ed for multi-user systems; influential but obscure outside OS history buffs.

SLED: IBM’s “Source Line EDitor” used on VM/CMS and other mainframe environments. Very much in the edlin/ed tradition.

BBC Micro *EDIT: A built‑in line editor for BASIC programs, invoked with *EDIT.

Commodore PET/CBM EDIT: PET BASIC had a primitive line editor for program entry.

Apple II EDASM: The assembler package included a line editor for source code.

TRS‑80 Editor/Assembler: Another line‑based editor bundled with the assembler.

ZX Spectrum’s built‑in BASIC editor: Not a separate program, but its quirky line‑editing model is worth noting.
BBC Micro *EDIT: A command that invoked a line editor for BASIC programs. It let you step through code line by line, editing text without a full‑screen interface.


Commodore PET/CBM EDIT: PET BASIC had a primitive line editor where you typed line numbers and could only edit by re‑entering them. Later CBM machines kept similar quirks.

Apple II EDASM: The assembler package included a line editor for source code. Editing assembler mnemonics line by line was the norm.

TRS‑80 Editor/Assembler: Bundled with the assembler, it provided a bare‑bones line editor that felt closer to edlin than to modern editors.

ZX Spectrum BASIC editor: Not a separate program, but its unique “keyword entry” model (pressing keys to insert whole BASIC commands) made editing quirky and constrained.
